          <p>The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) was founded in 1929 by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Lillie P. Bliss, and Mary Quinn Sullivan, with the aim of being North America's first museum dedicated exclusively to modern art. Today it houses more than 200,000 works from various disciplines.</p>

          <h2>The Starry Night</h2>
          <p>Van Gogh gazed out the window of the Saint-Rémy asylum. He had lost his earlobe and was increasingly plagued by hallucinations.
When he looked at the cypress trees in the garden, they seemed to vibrate. When he looked at the night sky, the stars seemed alive. That is what he captured in this canvas, which is now one of the most famous in the history of art.
Throughout his career, the artist would paint both cypress trees and stars, both with a distinctly symbolic character, but this work is perhaps the one that best communicates his unique style
With his vigorous brushstrokes, Van Gogh captures both an exterior and an interior landscape. The swirling sky seems to truly move on the canvas. The stars have their own halos, which the painter exaggerates to express more (and anticipating Expressionism by decades).

The city, on the other hand, is still and stable, rendered with short, straight strokes, in contrast to the frenetic curves of the sky.

The Post-Impressionist painter said, "I want to reach the point where people say of my work, 'This man feels deeply,'" to which we would add, "and makes others feel deeply
Poor, alone, despised, hypersensitive, the artist had given up everything for art, becoming the first martyr of modern art and a romantic figure representing "the uncontaminated artist."

Van Gogh died months after painting this masterpiece. He was 37 years old and died two days later. His brother and patron, Theo, was by his side and would also die shortly afterward from a mental and physical collapse brought on by syphilis...."</p>

          <h2>The Lovers</h2>
          <p>Two unidentified figures kiss behind two damp veils.

A secret love…? A forbidden love…? Two strangers drawn to each other without knowing one another…? The callousness of some loves…? Blind love…? The surrealist Magritte explains nothing. He only leaves us with that feeling of suffocation, which is perhaps just another symptom to illustrate love.

Again, the artist plays with the idea of ​​interior-exterior: We don't know if that blue wall is painted or if it's the sky.

Magritte also returns to one of his recurring themes: The damp veils allude to his mother's suicide, drowned in a river. In the mind of a 13-year-old artist, the image of wet clothing covering his mother's face remained.</p>

          <h2>Campbell’s Soup Cans</h2>
          <p>This artwork is called Campbell's Soup Cans, and it was created by the American artist Andy Warhol.
It depicts 32 cans of soup, each with a different flavor.
Warhol used this image to show that everyday objects can also be art.
He wanted people to think about consumer culture and mass production.
It became one of the most famous works of Pop Art.</p>

          <h2>Bird in Space</h2>
          <p>Constantin Brâncuși's Bird in Space is a masterpiece of modern sculpture that represents the impulse of flight rather than the physical form of the bird. Created in 1923 and reproduced in marble and bronze in more than a dozen versions, this stylized and polished piece seeks to capture the essence of upward movement, spirituality, and freedom. Its radical abstraction sparked debates about what should be considered art and was even the subject of a trial in the United States that redefined the boundaries of contemporary sculpture.</p>

          <h2>Untitled Film Still #21</h2>
          <p>This photo was taken by Cindy Sherman, an artist who photographs herself pretending to be different movie characters.
In this image, she looks like a woman from an old film, looking off-screen with mystery and confidence.
Sherman uses these photos to question how women are represented in movies.
With just one image, she makes us think about identity, cinema, and stereotypes.</p>

          <h2>Water Lilies</h2>
          <p>There are approximately 250 water lilies painted by Monet in the last years of his life. The elderly painter lived in the Garden of Giverny, where he installed a Japanese bridge and a pond with exotic plants that served as models and inspiration.

Monet was already established, but he continued to explore the pictorial possibilities of color variations within the same subject, depending on the time of day or the seasons.

In these later works, the forms are practically dissolved into patches of color. Many art historians/ophthalmologists (yes, they exist…) claim that because Monet suffered from cataracts, the artist saw through a blurry, yellowish filter. In fact, after his surgery, he briefly returned to his earlier style
Of all these water lily paintings, perhaps the most famous and spectacular are the panels exhibited at the Musée de l'Orangerie in the Tuileries Gardens, Paris. Monet painted them to be displayed in a 360° circular room, and they are considered "the Sistine Chapel of Impressionism."

But another striking work is the one you see above. An enormous canvas, two meters high by six meters wide. In it, we see only water, plants, and the reflection of the outside world. Monet immerses us in this strange landscape of reds, yellows, and mauves. He overwhelms us with the breathtaking beauty and harmony of his canvases.

The work as a whole seems unreal. Up close, it is pure abstract art. From a distance, they are indeed the most perfect water lilies ever painted.....</p>
